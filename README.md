# Decentralized Supply Chain Management System using Blockchain for Real-Time Product Traceability 📦⛓️


This Project is a decentralized tracking ecosystem designed to bring radical transparency to global supply chains. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, it creates an immutable audit trail for products from the point of manufacture to the end consumer.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Stakeholder Architecture:** Integrated workflows for Manufacturers, Distributors, and Retailers.
- **Ownership Verification:** Cryptographically signed handshakes ensure that goods cannot be "ghost-transferred."
- **Real-Time Status Tracking:** Instant updates on product state (Produced, Shipped, Received, Sold).
- **Anti-Counterfeit Mechanism:** Every product has a unique on-chain ID, making it impossible to inject fake goods into the verified stream.
- **Web3 Integrated:** Seamless connection with MetaMask for secure transaction signing.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The project follows a standard DApp architecture:
* **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, managing the state machine of the supply chain.
* **Frontend:** React-based dashboard for intuitive interaction with the blockchain.
* **Middleware:** Ethers.js/Web3.js acting as the bridge between the UI and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
